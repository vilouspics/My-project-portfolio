      <p>
        Three years ago, SheCodes sparked my curiosity, but my journey had to
        wait as I immersed myself in Python and SQL for consulting. With a
        background in art history and architecture, I knew a creative spark was
        missing in my daily life. Rediscovering SheCodes felt like finding a
        long-lost passion, and diving into the world of coding just made sense.

        <p>
          My first project was full of pastel colors that feel like home, and it
          was so special to have Rey and Chewie cheering me on (from their
          naps). It’s amazing how these colors have become a theme in my work,
          and it all started here!

          <p>
            The SheCodes Basic Add-on Course was the perfect push for me to take
            coding to the next level! After already having so much fun with the
            Basic Course, the Add-on allowed me to dive deeper into creating a
            CrossFit-inspired project dedicated to my passion for sports and the
            CrossFit community.I aimed to capture the sense of community and
            support that I love about CrossFit in a digital form.

          <p>
            The World Clock project was a thrilling exploration of JavaScript
            Date Formats and Time Zones! As we dove into the course, I was
            captivated by how we can manipulate time in so many ways.
            Understanding the intricacies of time zones opened up a whole new
            world for me, enabling me to create a functional clock that connects
            different parts of the globe.

          <p>
            I’m genuinely proud of what I’ve accomplished with this project!
            Building my Weather App during the SheCodes Plus workshop has been
            one of the most rewarding experiences of my coding journey. Watching
            it come to life with real data felt magical, and the pastel tones
            made it even more special.

          <p>
            After taking a break from coding due to work commitments, I felt a
            bit apprehensive about diving back in. But luckily, I quickly found
            my footing again! With AI being such a hot topic these days, it was
            exciting to explore its potential and create something impactful. As
            someone who is passionate about CrossFit, proper nutrition is key to
            my journey. This need inspired my project!
