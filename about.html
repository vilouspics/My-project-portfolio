          <p>
            A few months ago, my partner and I, along with our two Vizslas,
            Chewie and Rey, moved from Berlin to the coast of Schleswig-Holstein
            after over 10 years in the city — with a few stops along the way in
            Frankfurt, London, and New York. The fresh air and natural
            surroundings here have been incredible for me, especially after a
            period when my body made it clear I needed to start listening to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            After studying Architecture, Art History, and Italian, I spent years
            in the art world and then with two of the Big Four before
            transitioning into IT consulting — a path that, while rewarding, was
            full of unexpected twists. It wasn’t always easy, partly due to
            others' expectations but also my own. Many times, I found myself
            wondering,
            <em
              >What if I fail? What if I’m not good enough? And was it really
              the right choice to leave behind what I knew for something
              unknown?</em
            >
            Now, I try to turn these thoughts around:
            <em>But what if it all works out?</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            This is exactly the mindset I hope to pass on to my younger
            colleagues. Currently, I work full-time as a Product Owner and
            Engagement Manager for a developer team spread across Europe. I’m a
            huge fan of remote work (after all, it allows me to live where
            others go on holiday), but it has its challenges too. Keeping the
            team connected and creating a safe environment where they feel
            supported and can thrive is something I genuinely enjoy. I believe
            in continuous growth, and sometimes the best way to learn is through
            making mistakes. After all, we’re all just human, and even if the
            work is fulfilling, a supportive environment and attention to mental
            health are essential for sustained well-being and motivation.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, how did I get into web design? When I first started in IT
            consulting, I was introduced to data warehouses, Python, and SQL,
            and I remember wondering why it didn’t quite click for me. I enjoy
            coding and have a love for languages, but something felt missing.
            Then I stumbled upon SheCodes, and after the first mini-workshop, I
            was hooked — the visual side was the missing link.
          </p>
          <p>
            And here I am now! Even though it’s tough to keep up with learning
            when you have a demanding full-time job, a household, two dogs, and
            a fitness routine, finding that balance is worth it. Everything I’ve
            learned so far also benefits my job, and I don’t regret for a second
            having taken on a new challenge. I’m excited to see where this path
            will lead!
